# Data Directory - Simulation Data

This directory contains simulation data files (CSV) used for the Monte Carlo risk analysis and other actuarial calculations.

## Files

- `completed_units.csv` - Completed construction units data
- `monte_carlo_results.csv` - Monte Carlo simulation results
- `risk_events.csv` - Risk event data
- `risk_statistics.txt` - Risk statistics summary
- `risk_tables.csv` - Risk tables
- `scenario_a_perfect.csv` - Perfect scenario simulation
- `scenario_b_no_insurance.csv` - No insurance scenario
- `scenario_c_with_insurance.csv` - With insurance scenario
- `GC_roster.csv` - General contractor roster

## Policy Data

**Note**: The `simulatedPolicies.json` file is located in `docs/data/simulatedPolicies.json` (not here) because the website serves from the `docs/` directory. That is the single source of truth for policy data.

To edit policy data, edit: `captive.integralmass.com/docs/data/simulatedPolicies.json`
