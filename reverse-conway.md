Reverse Conway Organization Structure for the Richards Systems
This structure is designed to optimize communication and workflow based on the steps in the Richards Systems process, fostering an abundance perspective through collaboration and shared understanding.

Organizational Structure:

Research & Development Hub: This central hub houses cross-functional teams focused on specific aspects of the research process. Teams include:

News Crawling & Market Analysis Team: Responsible for gathering and analyzing market data, including news, demand, annual reports, and risk factors.

Framework Alignment Team: Ensures alignment with relevant frameworks (DOD, Zachman, Enterprise Architecture).

Product Viability Assessment Team: Evaluates the potential of identified products, considering people, profitability, and market fit.

CAD/PLM Team: This team takes viable product concepts and develops CAD models, integrating them into PLM tools for sprint planning and change management.

CRM & People Management Team: Manages the CRM system, allocating and tracking personnel resources based on project needs and individual expertise.

Financial Modeling & Simulation Team: Utilizes Matlab, Netsuite, and Netlogo to simulate potential profitability and financial scenarios.

Risk Management Team: Employs the HAPI FHIR service to model and assess risk factors.

Communication Channels:

Centralized Communication Platform: A platform (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams) facilitates communication and information sharing across all teams.

Regular Cross-Team Meetings: Scheduled meetings ensure alignment and knowledge transfer between different stages of the research process.

Project-Specific Channels: Dedicated channels for individual projects allow focused communication and collaboration.

Knowledge Repository: A centralized repository (e.g., Confluence, Google Workspace) stores research data, reports, and project documentation, promoting transparency and knowledge sharing.

Three-Story Floor Plan (Insurance Building Framework)

This floor plan adapts the traditional insurance building architecture to the Richards Systems, promoting collaboration and efficient workflow.

Floor 1: Data & Operations

100 cubicles for "Claims Handlers" who in this context are Data Analysts responsible for cleaning, processing, and preparing data for analysis.

5-person cubby for DBAs (Database Administrators) who manage and maintain the databases supporting the research process.

Open collaboration spaces with whiteboards and comfortable seating for brainstorming and problem-solving.

Floor 2: Research & Analysis

100 cubicles for "Underwriters" who are now Researchers conducting market analysis, framework alignment, and product viability assessments.

5-person cubby for "Actuaries" who are now Research Leads providing guidance and expertise to the research teams.

Meeting rooms equipped with video conferencing and presentation tools for team meetings and knowledge sharing sessions.

Floor 3: Strategy & Simulation

100 cubicles for "Financial Analysts" who are now Simulation & Modeling Specialists using various tools to simulate profitability and risk factors.

5-person cubby for "Chief Executives" who are now Strategic Decision-Makers responsible for evaluating research findings and making strategic decisions.

Executive boardroom for high-level meetings and strategic planning sessions.

Key Considerations:

Abundance Perspective: The floor plan encourages open communication and collaboration, with shared spaces and meeting rooms to foster a sense of community and shared purpose.

Flexibility: The cubicle layout allows for individual focus while maintaining proximity to colleagues for easy collaboration.

Technology Integration: The building is equipped with high-speed internet, video conferencing, and other technologies to support remote collaboration and data access.

Sustainability: The building incorporates sustainable design features to minimize environmental impact and promote employee well-being.

This Reverse Conway structure and floor plan aim to create an environment that supports the Richards Systems' re-search process, fostering an abundance perspective through collaboration, knowledge sharing, and efficient communication.
