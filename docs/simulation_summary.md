# Integral Mass Captive Insurance - Simulation Summary

**Generated:** 2026-01-25 10:40:12

## Executive Summary

This report presents the results of comprehensive simulations demonstrating the actuarial soundness of the Integral Mass Captive Insurance model.

## 1. Financial Instrument Analysis

The multi-generational equity instrument demonstrates strong performance:

- **Scenario A (Perfect Payments):** 100.0% equity vested
- **Scenario B (No Insurance):** 100.0% equity vested
- **Scenario C (With Insurance):** 100.0% equity vested

**Key Finding:** Insurance coverage maintains equity accumulation trajectory even during payment disruptions.

## 2. Queuing Simulation Results

Resource allocation across 12 General Contractors:

- **Total Units Completed:** 104
- **Average Wait Time:** 0.0 days
- **Risk Event Rate:** 22.1%

**Key Finding:** The GC network demonstrates sufficient capacity with manageable wait times across all three market segments.

## 3. Monte Carlo Risk Analysis

10-year solvency projection (5,000 simulations):

- **Mean Final Capital:** $7,422,196.96
- **Probability of Ruin:** 0.00%
- **Mean Solvency Ratio:** 164.94
- **5th Percentile Capital:** $7,198,871.92

**Key Finding:** The captive maintains strong solvency with less than 0.0% probability of ruin over 10 years.

## Regulatory Compliance

This simulation demonstrates:

1. **Risk Distribution:** 12 independent risk units (GCs) across 3 uncorrelated markets
2. **Adequate Capitalization:** Initial capital of $1M provides 164.9x coverage
3. **Operational Viability:** Queuing analysis confirms sustainable installation capacity

## Conclusion

The Integral Mass Captive Insurance model is actuarially sound and operationally viable for Arizona Captive Insurance Association licensing.
